My solutions to advent of code problems.

Most s have the following:
* a numbered *.py file, the equivalent of 'main' for that .
* a numbered *_input.txt file containing the sample input for that .
* a numbered *_test.txt file, containing test input for the .

Example files:
* 1.py - main for  1.
* 1_test.txt - test input for  1.
* 1_input.txt - input for  1.
